Places a through hole Pad over selected via(s) to make thermal reliefs and pads exposed for soldering.

This is mainly for DIY circuit boards with vias that need to be soldered to. 
Use this along with the ""Do not tent vias"" option. 
I'm soldering a wire from the top to bottom via pad but you can use this to solder eyelets too.
The original via is deleted to eliminate repeated drill hits.

From no thermal relief and no bottom via pads...
